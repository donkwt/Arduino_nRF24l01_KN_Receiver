# Arduino_nRF24l01_KN_Receiver
Arduino nRF24l01 (using RF24 library) KN protocol (WLtoys) RC-Receiver, receiving signals from WLtoys PowerStar X1 transmitter

I used this lib together with the stm32duino library and a modification of RF24 library if you want to use it just with normal Arduino uncomment neccessary lines in the header file.
